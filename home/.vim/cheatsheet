Notes
=====
In general, a couple of rules are used:

* All custom keybindings start with <Leader>.
* <Leader>x is used as an 'extension' to provide more options for bindings.
* In some cases, multiple bindings are used for a single letter (e.g. <Leader>q and <Leader>Q). In those cases, the capitalized version is always used for commands that have more side-effects (e.g. <Leader>q closes one window, <Leader>Q closes all windows).

General
=======
; - The Leader key. Used in any binding where "<Leader>" is present.
    e.g. in Command-T below, where <Leader>t is listed, that is (by default)
    a mapping for ";t". The Leader key can be changed in 
    config/general_keys.vim.

<Leader>q - quit the current window.
<Leader>Q - quit all windows (exit this vim session)

<Leader>w - write the current buffer (save).
<Leader>W - write the current buffer and quit the current window.

<Leader>h - move to the window to the left of the current window.
<Leader>j - move to the window below the current window.
<Leader>k - move to the window above the current window.
<Leader>l - move to the window to the right of the current window.

Ack.vim
=======
<Leader>a - Prompt you for a string to :Ack!

Command-T
=========
<Leader>t  - Display Command-T window.
<Leader>b  - Display Command-T buffer window.
<Leader>xt - Clear Command-T cache. 

Fugitive
========
<Leader>gs  - Display git status.
<Leader>gb  - Display git blame.
<Leader>gl  - Display git log.
